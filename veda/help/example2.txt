example 2 - simple photoshop

1. serialization (convert objects to a continuous string):

- a picture is made up of layers
- each layer contains a frame
- a frame is a series of transformations applied upon a background

e.g. http://bit.ly/1KeZpEb

layer 1 = couple photo = (add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)
layer 2 = forest background = (add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)

photo = {1. [(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)], 2. [(add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)]}


2. updates:
{[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)]} --> 
{[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)], [(add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)]}

*note, this update is rudimentary. simply adding a background to the couple's photo

OT update: (1. s 43, 2. i ", [(add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)]")

let "|" be the cursor
1. |{[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)]}
2. {[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)]|}
3. {[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)]|, [(add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)]}
final: {[(add photo.jpg), (shift right by 300px)], [(add forest.jpg), (enlarge to cover frame)]}
