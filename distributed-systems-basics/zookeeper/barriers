Client calls the ZooKeeper API's exists() function on the barrier node, with watch set to true.

If exists() returns false, the barrier is gone and the client proceeds

Else, if exists() returns true, the clients wait for a watch event from ZooKeeper for the barrier node.

When the watch event is triggered, the client reissues the exists( ) call, again waiting until the barrier node is removed
