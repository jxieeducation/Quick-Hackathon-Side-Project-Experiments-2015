READ: 


    Call create( ) to create a node with pathname "_locknode_/read-". This is the lock node use later in the protocol. Make sure to set both the sequence and ephemeral flags.

    Call getChildren( ) on the lock node without setting the watch flag - this is important, as it avoids the herd effect.

    If there are no children with a pathname starting with "write-" and having a lower sequence number than the node created in step 1, the client has the lock and can exit the protocol.

    Otherwise, call exists( ), with watch flag, set on the node in lock directory with pathname staring with "write-" having the next lowest sequence number.

    If exists( ) returns false, goto step 2.

    Otherwise, wait for a notification for the pathname from the previous step before going to step 2


WRITE:


    Call create( ) to create a node with pathname "_locknode_/write-". This is the lock node spoken of later in the protocol. Make sure to set both sequence and ephemeral flags.

    Call getChildren( ) on the lock node without setting the watch flag - this is important, as it avoids the herd effect.

    If there are no children with a lower sequence number than the node created in step 1, the client has the lock and the client exits the protocol.

    Call exists( ), with watch flag set, on the node with the pathname that has the next lowest sequence number.

    If exists( ) returns false, goto step 2. Otherwise, wait for a notification for the pathname from the previous step before going to step 2.
